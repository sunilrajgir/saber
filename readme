I don't recommend saber tool for any iOS app due to below reason-
 1. very very hard to debug => looks like working on Low level language
 2. It generates swift file => increases compile time [since number of swift file will always increase in iOS project hence tool will take more time in future]
 3. inject dependencies at run time => decreases application performance
 4. AppContainer file size will always increase
 5. Continuous changes in Swift Syntax, Xcode, system => [canâ€™t rely on saber tool]
This is my personal view on saber tool.
